# My-Projects
This repository is a curated collection of practical, hands-on projects that reflect my journey across data science, data analysis, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and modern digital solutions. Each project is built with real-world application in mind, combining technical depth with clear, production-ready workflows. The goal of this repository is not only to showcase my skills, but to continuously refine and expand my capabilities across key technologies including Python, SQL, Power BI, WordPress, and various machine learning and AI frameworks.

Inside this repository, you will find end-to-end data analytics projects where I clean, transform, and model datasets using Python and SQL while incorporating exploratory data analysis and insightful visualizations. My approach prioritizes well-structured code, reproducible pipelines, and documentation that makes each project easy to understand and build upon. You will also find advanced data science work involving machine learning models, feature engineering, evaluation metrics, and experiments with frameworks such as PyTorch for deep learning and applied AI tasks.

A significant part of my focus is on business-driven analytics. Several projects are connected to Power BI dashboards designed to deliver meaningful insights, using optimized data models, DAX measures, and calculations that demonstrate strong analytical thinking. These dashboards show not just technical skill, but an understanding of how data can drive decisions in real environments.

Additionally, I include cybersecurity-related labs and exercises to strengthen my understanding of digital security principles, ethical practices, and defensive techniques. These projects are safe, controlled, and focused on practical learning within virtualized environments.

Finally, this repository also contains selected WordPress builds and portfolio-oriented web components that demonstrate my ability to create functional, user-friendly websites and digital systems that support data-driven content.

Overall, this repository represents my ongoing development as a data-driven problem solver. Each project reflects curiosity, continuous learning, and the pursuit of professional-grade work across multiple complementary fields. As I grow, this repository will continue to evolve with new, more advanced, and more impactful projects.
